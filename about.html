            The founders of the Zoya Group established a Not for Profit Trust named the Zoya Educational Trust
            in the early 2010’s to deliver high quality education to Pakistani youth. They were of the firm belief that
            good quality education is crucial for Pakistan’s development into a first world country.

            They made valuable contributions with their experience and wisdom, which were instrumental in the success of
            the newly born Zoya International School which in a short span of time became a premier
            educational institution. 

            With a rich history exceeding Ten years, the Zoya International School is the largest not for
            profit school in Pakistan. Our student body consists of 7,600 boys and girls pursuing education following
            either the Matriculation or the Senior Cambridge curriculum. We have a modern campus with three auditoriums,
            well designed classrooms, science and information technology laboratories, well maintained playgrounds, a
            modern swimming pool, and four gymnasiums. We have a finishing school for girls with foreign certified
            faculty, a teacher training center, a school of arts, and a school of music. We have exclusive arrangements
            for teaching of Qirat and Naat.

            All these facilities enable us to provide education that helps individuals develop an economically stable
            life, a passion for gratitude, compassion, integrity and responsibility. An extensive range of opportunities
            and broad spectrum of curriculum provides the large student population at CMS with a broad knowledge sharing
            platform, enabling them to become well rounded responsible citizens.

            As a whole, the school has been providing quality, affordable and accessible education to the community for
            over Ten years, preparing both men and women alike to experience economic growth and a purposeful life.
            With the “no child left behind” policy, the Zoya International School has graduated agents of
            positive change who have helped reduce inequities within our society. Our resolve is stronger than ever
            before to meet the challenges of these turbulent times, with confidence.
